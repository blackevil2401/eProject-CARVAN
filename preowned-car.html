						There are a number of advantages that come along with certification:</p>
					<div class="summary-content-container">
						<p class="summary-info"><strong>A multipoint inspection:</strong> An automaker or dealer
							will

							get a
							warranty that extends the miles covered, the months remaining, or both to the
							bumper-to-bumper
							warranty or powertrain warranty.</p>
						<p class="summary-info"><strong>Other incentives:</strong> CPO cars often come with a
							vehicle
							history report at no extra charge, roadside assistance programs and more.</p>
						<p class="summary-info"><strong></strong> One element to weigh, though, is that CPO cars
							typically
							run more expensive than non-CPO cars, so consider the benefits versus that extra cost
							and

												<p>The road to owning a new-to-you car can be fraught with potholes. New
													cars experience depreciation — at least 10 percent in the first
													month — and used cars can be something of a mystery when it comes to
													knowing the vehicle’s condition, but there’s another option that
													gives shoppers almost the same assurances of a new car but without
													the new-car price: certified pre-owned vehicles.</p>
												<p>CPO vehicles are typically late-model-year vehicles with
													manufacturer-backed warranties. Most CPO vehicles are in good
													condition and have relatively low miles, and many of them are
													off-lease cars, which means they’ve reached the end of their lease
													contract. For a charge of about $1,500 on average, a certified
													technician performs a multipoint inspection of the CPO car and makes
													any necessary repairs. With CPO vehicles, dealers and automakers
													typically offer extended powertrain warranties and other benefits,
													such as roadside assistance and a vehicle history report. A CPO
													vehicle may come with lower interest financing, as well.</p>
												<p>With certified pre-owned cars, you’re paying for peace of mind.</p>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">Who Does the Certifying?</h2>
												<p>A “factory” or manufacturer CPO vehicle is certified to the
													automaker’s standards and licensed dealers pay a fee to get that
													certification. It’s all in the family, too. A Mercedes-Benz dealer
													only sells Mercedes CPO vehicles, so there should be quality
													assurances that the dealer did good work. A dealer-certified car has
													been inspected by a tech in the dealer’s service center. An
													independent dealer can offer an extended warranty or a vehicle with
													a CPO warranty still active from a previous owner. As with all
													things, check the paperwork.</p>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">Is a CPO Vehicle Worth It?</h2>
												<p>It depends. You can be sure the CPO vehicle will be less expensive
													than the new model in the same generation, and more expensive than a
													used model without certification. And every automaker has different
													standards when it comes to maximum age and mileage of the car,
													warranties and even the number of items inspected.
												<p>In some cases, the extra cost for a CPO car may not be worth it,
													especially on a model from a reliable automaker that is relatively
													new with relatively low miles. Hyundai and Kia models, for example,
													have the industry’s best powertrain warranty of 10 years or 100,000
													miles, but that warranty applies to the original owner only. Many
													new cars have bumper-to-bumper warranties good for three years and
													36 months.</p>
												<p>“Anyone considering CPO should check to see if there is a remaining
													factory warranty that comes with the car for no extra charge,” Reed
													said.</p>
												<p>For car shoppers, a CPO vehicle minimizes some of the legwork and
													certain risks.</p>
												<p>“Buying a CPO car allows you to buy a much cheaper car that is still
													reliable and provides the peace of mind that comes with an extended
													warranty,” Reed said.</p>

												<p> When shopping for a used car, you’ll often see listings for CPO, or
													certified pre-owned</a> vehicles. While that looks good in ads,
													its meaning can vary greatly.</p>
												<p> Generally speaking, CPO certification means that a vehicle has been
													through some sort of pre-sale inspection, typically involving more
													than 100 items from the engine and transmission to tires, battery,
													cosmetic appearance and more. In theory, issues with these are
													addressed. If they cannot be, the vehicle doesn’t make the cut.</p>
												<p> Depending on the manufacturer and/or the dealer, certification also
													includes limitations on the vehicle’s age, how many miles are on it
													and whether it has been in an accident, flood or otherwise has an
													undesirable history.</p>
												<p> Other benefits of buying a CPO vehicle can include an extended
													warranty, roadside service, scheduled dealer maintenance and use of
													a loaner while the vehicle is in the shop. <a
														href="http://www.gmcertified.com/certified-benefits">Chevrolet</a>,
													for example, includes all the above and adds an additional 12 months
													or 12,000 miles of limited bumper-to-bumper warranty. The powertrain
													warranty gets a boost to six years or 100,000 miles. <a
														href="https://automobiles.honda.com/images/certified-used/downloads/HCUCbrochure.pdf">Honda</a>
													offers the same extension for its comprehensive coverage and extends
													its powertrain warranty to seven years or 100,000 miles.</p>
												<p> While limiting your search to CPO vehicles can weed out some
													turkeys, it is no guarantee of getting a good, reliable car. And CPO
													vehicles generally carry a price premium over non-CPO examples of
													the same make and model, from a couple hundred dollars to more than
													$1,000.</p>
												<p> Another thing to watch for is that as CPO has emerged as a buzz
													phrase in the used-car world, less-than-scrupulous independent
													dealers can slap CPO signs on just about anything, making
													“certification” nothing more than another piece of paper.</p>
												<p> Always insist on seeing the specifics of what has been inspected and
													any repairs that have been made. Make sure you understand any
													additional warranties and other coverage, how that compares to the
													original warranty and what exactly is included. It’s still a good
													idea to take any vehicle you’re considering to an independent
													mechanic for a second opinion.</p>
												<p> Above all, start by choosing a model with good safety and
													reliability ratings. That way you’re already ahead of the game.</p>

												<p> At most new-car dealerships, you will encounter certified pre-owned
													vehicles, which have become big business.
													They are a popular choice for consumers because CPO cars offer more
													of
													what many buyers crave in a used vehicle: peace of mind.</p>
												<p>The term “certified” means that a dealer has certified to the
													manufacturer that the car passed a multipoint inspection that can
													encompass 150 or more items and has been repaired as needed to
													qualify
													for the CPO program. Dealers are supposed to file paperwork with the
													manufacturer to support this and pay a fee to obtain CPO status for
													the
													vehicle.</p>
												<p>Every major manufacturer offers CPO vehicles, and recent estimates
													show
													that more than 20 percent of the used cars sold by new-car dealers
													are
													CPO vehicles, accounting for more than 2.6 million vehicles in 2016.
													Some dealer groups, and even individual dealers, offer their own
													certification programs, but they are different from the CPO programs
													backed by vehicle manufacturers.</p>
												<p>CPO vehicles usually are priced higher than non-CPO used cars (that
													difference can be from several hundred dollars to a couple of
													thousand)
													because they are touted as the best used cars available. They are
													supposed to have been reconditioned to like-new condition, they’re
													backed by a manufacturer’s warranty and they come with additional
													benefits that may not be provided on other used cars.</p>
												<p>In other words, certified pre-owned cars offer most of what you would
													get
													with a new car — including that new-car smell — but at a lower
													price.
												</p>
												<p>Age and mileage limits to becoming a CPO vehicle vary
													by manufacturer, but the vehicles are usually less than 6 years
													old and have fewer than 80,000 miles. In addition, the CPO programs
													extend the manufacturer’s original basic or powertrain warranties
													(or
													both) and often include roadside assistance and a free vehicle
													history
													report.</p>
												<p>Moreover, certified pre-owned vehicles often are available with
													low-interest financing from the manufacturer that is lower than what
													many consumers would be able to get on other used cars.</p>
												<p>CPO programs started with luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and
													Lexus,
													but with all major manufacturers now involved, the most popular
													programs
													belong to the top-selling brands: Toyota, Honda, Chevrolet and Ford.
												</p>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">Tips for Buying a CPO Car</h2>
												<p>Here are some tips before buying a CPO car:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Make sure you know if the car is certified by the manufacturer
														or
														the dealer. Their certification requirements may differ; if it’s
														from the manufacturer, you’ll be able to have your vehicle
														serviced
														at locations nationwide.</li>
													<li>Ask to see the certification checklist to make sure all major
														components have been inspected.</li>
													<li>Insist on a vehicle repair and maintenance history report.</li>
													<li>Make sure the remainder of the new-car warranty is clear and in
														writing.</li>
													<li>Read the fine print on the CPO warranty. Most certified used-car
														warranties cover only the powertrain; if you want
														bumper-to-bumper
														coverage, you may have to purchase that separately. Some
														warranties
														are much longer than others. Some warranties are transferable;
														others are not.</li>
													<li>Pay attention to both the age and mileage limits in the
														warranty.
														Chances are, you’ll hit the mileage limit first.</li>
													<li>Get details on the return policy. Is there one? Within what time
														frame? Will the dealer refund registration and license fees and
														sales tax as well?</li>
													<li>Take the certified used car for a nice, long test drive.</li>
													<li>Haggle away. Just because a used car is certified doesn’t mean
														you
														can’t, or shouldn’t, negotiate on price as you would with any
														other
														car.</li>
												</ul>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">How Much Does Certification Add to the Price of a Used Car?</h2>
												<p>While CPO cars can offer consumers peace of mind, buyers can often
													pay a
													price for that added confidence. Auto manufacturers tack on anywhere
													from 2 to 8 percent of the original used-car price for that
													certification sticker, experts say. Typically, the higher-end the
													model
													or brand, the higher the percentage on the certified pre-owned car.
												</p>
												<p>Although no current data suggest that certified used cars are vastly
													more
													reliable than their noncertified brethren, they do come with the
													suggestion of better roadworthiness.</p>
												<p>Manufacturers place restrictions on what cars can be certified and
													offer
													multipoint inspection processes that vary from program to program.
												</p>
												<p>Don’t put too much stock in certification itself. Inspection
													checklists
													should not be relied on as precise indicators of the car’s
													condition,
													experts say. They are more likely to give you an overall picture of
													the
													car’s health today, but not for tomorrow.</p>
												<p>One bonus of certification is that it gives car shoppers the
													opportunity
													to buy up in a category, a purchasing experience they might
													otherwise be
													unable to attain. For example, it might allow a consumer to move
													into a
													certified pre-owned luxury car rather than a decked-out economy car.
													That helps manufacturers, too, as they see these shoppers as
													potential
													longtime fans of their brand.</p>
												<p>Consumers can also benefit: CPO programs create vehicles with higher
													resale values, providing increased bargaining power when it’s time
													to
													trade the car in.</p>
												<p>Often, reduced-rate financing options are available for CPO
													purchasers.
													While you may not find the zero-percent deals occasionally offered
													on
													new vehicles, you <em>will </em>find low interest rates on many
													certified models.</p>

												<p>Certified pre-owned vehicles are touted as the best used cars —
													off-lease or late-model vehicles that received plenty of TLC from
													the previous owner and didn’t need major repairs or reconditioning
													to restore them to showroom condition. But despite their like-new
													appearance and all the promises, CPO vehicles may be no better than
													other used cars in some regards.</p>
												<p>Here are some pros and cons to buying a CPO vehicle:</p>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">Pros</h2>
												<ul>
													<li>They come with warranty coverage and benefits, such as roadside
														assistance, that make buying the used car almost like buying a
														new car and provide greater peace of mind than a non-CPO
														vehicle.</li>
													<li>The dealer has certified that a multipoint inspection was
														performed and repairs were made where needed.</li>
													<li>They come with free vehicle history reports.</li>
													<li>Some pre-owned vehicles include buyback protection if the buyer
														later discovers the car had flood, fire damage or a rolled-back
														odometer.</li>
													<li>There are important issues to consider when thinking about a
														certified pre-owned car. Foremost is that they typically cost
														more than other used non-certified cars. At the least, the
														dealer will want to recover the CPO fee they pay to the
														manufacturer on such a car <strong>—</strong> which can range
														from a few hundred dollars to more than $1,000
														<strong>—</strong> on top of their normal profit on a used car.
														CPO sales have been running at record levels for a few years, so
														high demand has allowed dealers to charge much more for these
														CPO cars.</li>
												</ul>
												<h2 style="color: brown;">Cons</h2>
												<ul>
													<li>Vehicle history reports don’t include all accidents, and you may
														have no clue how a used CPO car was treated by the previous
														owner or whether they ever changed the oil.</li>
													<li>As with other used cars, some CPO program vehicles previously
														were road warriors for daily rental fleets (this will show on a
														history report). That means these pre-owned fleet vehicles had
														hundreds of different drivers, some of whom did not care how
														they treated the engine or suspension. Be on the lookout.</li>
													<li>A 150-point CPO checklist doesn’t guarantee the dealer did
														anything more than look <strong>—</strong> or that an inspection
														was performed. Although a vehicle history report may list
														repairs done by the dealer, many note only that the car was
														detailed and given fresh oil.</li>
													<li>Most late-model used vehicles probably still have their original
														battery, tires, and brake pads and rotors. This includes CPO
														vehicles. These typically are classified as “wear items” that
														aren’t covered by the CPO warranty and may be nearing the end of
														their useful life. Replacing them most likely will come out of
														your pocket.</li>
													<li>You don’t have to buy a CPO car to get a well-maintained used
														car. Most used vehicles fewer than 4 years old are in good
														shape, not just CPO vehicles. That’s because most drivers don’t
														abuse the vehicles they own or lease. Moreover, the only
														maintenance usually required during the first few years are oil
														changes, tire rotations and replacing engine and cabin air
														filters, so few late-model non-certified pre-owned vehicles are
														likely to be beaters.</li>
													<li>Many non-CPO, late-model used cars still have time and mileage
														remaining on the original basic and powertrain warranties that
														can be transferred to a second owner. It may even include
														roadside and towing assistance. Most late-model used vehicles
														also are eligible for a free third-party satellite radio trial.
													</li>

												<p>Whether you&#8217;re considering a new or
													used car, one option you should explore is a certified
													pre-owned vehicle. These are late-model vehicles that in
													many cases are nearly new and come with warranties comparable to
													those you would get with a brand new model. In addition, they often
													are available with low-rate financing similar to what is offered on
													new cars.</p>
												<p>CPO vehicles are offered by every major manufacturer, and sales have
													increased for several years in a row as more consumers recognize the
													benefits they offer. Analysts expect sales to grow again in 2017
													because the supply of late-model used vehicles will increase with a
													record number of off-lease vehicles entering the market, most of
													them three years old or less.</p>
												<p>In other words, it&#8217;s an excellent time to shop for a CPO
													vehicle.</p>
												<p>Before you start shopping, though, it pays to know what you&#8217;ll
													be looking at <strong>—</strong> and what you should look for.
													Explore the of CPO programs, the benefits they offer and some key
													tips
													for smart shoppers.</p>
												<p>Though there are several benefits to buying a CPO vehicle, there are
													drawbacks, such as a higher price. Know what the pros
													and cons are.</p>
												<p>Moreover, you might find that a CPO vehicle isn&#8217;t much cheaper
													than a new vehicle. Should you buy new instead? Here are the
													pluses and minuses</a>.</p>
												<p>On the other hand, buying a non-CPO used car with an extended
													warranty might give you more peace of mind and even save money in
													the long run. Explore that option here.</p>
												<p>If you do decide to buy a CPO vehicle, you might be tempted to opt
													for a luxury brand instead of one of the mainstream, lower-priced
													brands (such as BMW instead of Honda). That is another factor to
													weigh</p>

										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<div class="mainbody">
												<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="">
													<img itemprop="url" src="image/preowned-car/article-5.jpg"

												</figure>

												<p>You shouldn&#8217;t judge a book solely
													by its cover, and neither should you judge a certified pre-owned
													program only by its brochure. CPO programs vary widely in their
													warranty coverage, including whether vehicles can be exchanged. Here
													are key provisions to compare:</p>
												<p><strong>Inspection points:</strong> The number of items that are
													supposed to be inspected by a dealer
													before a vehicle is &#8220;certified&#8221; varies from as few as
													112 (Volkswagen) to as many as 300-plus (Audi). Some manufacturers
													don&#8217;t list a specific number and instead say the inspection is
													&#8220;comprehensive&#8221; or &#8220;rigorous.&#8221;</p>
												<p>The number can be misleading because some CPO programs may lump brake
													pads and rotors into one inspection point and others may list them
													separately. Whatever the number, the dealer is supposed to check not
													only vital parts such as the engine, transmission, suspension and
													brakes but to repair and replace as needed.</p>
												<p>Bear in mind that a part doesn&#8217;t have to be new to pass an
													inspection. Brake pads and rotors, for example, might pass a CPO
													inspection if they still have at least half of their useful
													thickness.</p>
												<p><strong>Finance rates:</strong> The lowest interest rates on car
													loans are on new vehicles, but loans on CPO vehicles are often
													available at lower rates than other used cars, and sometimes are
													even zero percent. The manufacturers help promote CPO sales by
													dangling interest rates that are close to those offered on new
													vehicles and, in some cases, that are the same.</p>
												<p>Lower interest rates make a difference. For example, the interest on
													a $20,000, four-year used-car loan at 4 percent would be $1,676. If
													a four-year loan on a CPO vehicle was available at 2.9 percent, the
													buyer would save $470 in interest. At 1.9 percent, the buyer would
													save nearly $900.</p>
												<p>These low-rate loans are offered by the captive finance units of the
													manufacturers (such as Ford Credit and Toyota Financial Services),
													and not all buyers will qualify. In addition, the lowest rates might
													only be for loans of 36 months or less.</p>
												<p><strong>Warranty terms:</strong> The remaining time and mileage from
													the original basic and/or powertrain warranties transfer to the
													buyer of a CPO vehicle, but with few exceptions neither the original
													nor CPO warranties cover maintenance items such as tires, brake
													linings, air filters and other &#8220;wear&#8221; parts.</p>
												<p>CPO programs typically also extend the basic warranty or the
													powertrain warranty, and many programs extend both, but the terms
													vary by brand, so this is a key component that shoppers should be
													clear on before they buy.
												</p>
												<p>Acura, Buick, Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, Honda and Mazda are among those
													that extend the basic warranty by 12 months/12,000 miles. Acura,
													Ford, Honda and Mazda extend the powertrain warranties on CPO
													vehicles, but Buick, Chevrolet and GMC don&#8217;t. On vehicles from
													Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (including Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and
													Ram), the basic CPO warranty is for three months/3,000 miles. Nissan
													doesn&#8217;t extend the original basic warranty on its CPO
													vehicles, only the powertrain warranty.</p>
												<p><strong>Deductibles:</strong> More than one-third of CPO programs
													have a per-visit deductible for warranty repairs. None is higher
													than $100, but it pays to ask ahead of time to avoid unpleasant
													surprises after the fact. Among those that do, BMW, Hyundai, Nissan
													and Toyota charge $50 per visit; Audi charges $85; and FCA, Ford and
													Lincoln charge $100.</p>
												<p><strong>Options to return a vehicle:</strong> In most cases, CPO
													vehicles cannot be returned for a refund or exchange. However,
													Acura, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC allow exchanges within the first
													three days, and Mercedes-Benz and Smart have a seven-day/500-mile
													exchange policy. With other brands, dealers may agree to an exchange
													on a case-by-case basis, but most times once you buy it, it&#8217;s
													yours.</p>
